# Active Constraints in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery
Implementation of a virtual fixture with motor redirection for robot assisted minimally invasive surgery, as described in *A Dynamic Non-Energy-Storing Guidance Constraint with Motion
Redirection for Robot-Assisted Surgery* (2020) from Nima Enayati, Eva C. Alves Costa, Giancarlo Ferrigno and Elena De Momi.

The project is deployable on a DaVinci Research Kit.

## Implementation 
The position and velocity of the End-Effector are tracked with respect to the path to be followed. The force is computed at each timestamp as a combination of such vectors. The MTM manipulator applies a resistance proportional to the magnitude of such force, contraining the movement of the PSM as close as possible to the trajectory.
A simulation environment is provided by the means of a UnityGame, where the virtual PSMs recieve commands by subscribing to a ROS topic published by the MTM himself.

In blue, the displacement vector from the path to the EE. In green, the EE velocity. In red, the restoring force, which clearly pulls towards the path.
