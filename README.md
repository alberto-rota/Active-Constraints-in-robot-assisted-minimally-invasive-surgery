# Active Constraints in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery
Implementation of a virtual fixture with motor redirection for robot assisted minimally invasive surgery, as described in *A Dynamic Non-Energy-Storing Guidance Constraint with Motion
Redirection for Robot-Assisted Surgery* (2020) from Nima Enayati, Eva C. Alves Costa, Giancarlo Ferrigno and Elena De Momi.

The project is deployable on a DaVinci Research Kit.

A simulation environment is set up in Unity with a virtual model of 2 PSMs of the DVRK and 1 ECM. The virtual robot is controlled from a physical master Manipulator wwhich sends the joint states in a ROS enivronment.

## Implementation 
The position and velocity of the End-Effector are tracked with respect to the path to be followed. The force is computed at each timestamp as a combination of such vectors. The MTM manipulator applies a resistance proportional to the magnitude of such force, contraining the movement of the PSM as close as possible to the trajectory.
A simulation environment is provided by the means of a UnityGame, where the virtual PSMs recieve commands by subscribing to a ROS topic published by the MTM himself.
